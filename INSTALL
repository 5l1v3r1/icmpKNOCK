How to use it
-------------
    a) Define some unique keys (MD5, SHA1 etc.)
    b) Define actions (check out icmpKNOCK_actions.py)
    c) run icmpKNOCK.py as root!!! otherwise you won't be able to listen
       for incoming ICMP requests
    d) Using your ping utility you can pass hex patterns to the requests:
       $ ping -p [hex pattern] [host]
